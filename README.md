<h1 align="left">Game Project</h1>

<p align="left">
  My name is <strong>Eduardo Corazin</strong>, and this is a game I managed to create thanks to one of the courses I took.  
  It’s a 2D platformer inspired by <em>Celeste</em>.
</p>

<h2 align="left">Development</h2>
<p align="left">
  The game was made entirely using <strong>GameMaker Language (GML)</strong>.
</p>

<h2 align="left">Features</h2>

<ul align="left">
  <li><strong>Pixel Art Style</strong> – charming visuals, some of which were provided by the course itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Soundtrack</strong> – inspired by classic platformer games.</li>
  <li><strong>Varied Level Design</strong> – each stage with its own style and difficulty.</li>
  <li><strong>Collectibles</strong> – challenging to obtain, shaped like bones.</li>
</ul>
